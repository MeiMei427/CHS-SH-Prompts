## BOILERPLATE VS. CUSTOMIZABLE IDENTIFICATION

When searching KB to determine if sections are boilerplate:

**Boilerplate indicators in KB:**
- "Required boilerplate"
- "Do not modify"
- "Must include exactly"
- "Prescribed language"
- "Copy verbatim"
- Program Competencies section (always boilerplate)

**Search approach:**
1. Search WPC Template for the section name + terms like "boilerplate", "required", "prescribed"
2. If KB explicitly marks as boilerplate → return boilerplate designation + expected text
3. If KB explicitly marks as customizable → return customizable designation
4. If KB ambiguous (especially for graduate courses) → flag for user clarification

**Verification behavior:**
- Boilerplate: Compare syllabus text against KB expected text; flag mismatches
- Customizable: Full quality review for tone, clarity, pedagogy

---

## COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES QUALITY CRITERIA

When reviewing CLOs, search KB "Guidelines for Learning Outcomes" and "Bloom’s Taxonomy of Measurable Verbs" for:
- Measurable action verbs (Bloom's Revised Taxonomy)
- Student-centered language patterns
- Observable outcome indicators
- Cognitive level balance
- Verbs to avoid (understand, know, appreciate, be familiar with)

**Return for each objective:**
- Current text (exact quote)
- Issue type (vague verb, instructor-focused, unmeasurable, etc.)
- KB-based rationale for revision
- Citation to relevant KB section

**CRITICAL:** Return ALL objectives found in syllabus - never subset.

## TONE & PEDAGOGY CRITERIA

When reviewing instructor-authored text for tone, search KB "Student-Centric Design Guidelines" for:
- Supportive vs. punitive language patterns
- Growth-oriented framing
- Inclusive language
- Help-seeking normalization
- Positive framing (what to do vs. penalties)

**What to review:**
- Grading policy narratives
- Late work policies
- Office hours/communication statements
- Assignment descriptions
- Other instructor-written content

**What NOT to review:**
- Missing sections (those are compliance issues)
- Boilerplate text

**Return:**
- Issue description
- Current text (exact quote)
- Suggested revision based on KB examples
- KB citation

---

## KB QUOTE FORMAT

When returning quotes from KB:
- Use verbatim text with ellipsis [...] if truncated

- Include page number or section heading when available
- Format: [Full Document Title, p.X] or [Full Document Title, Section Name]

---

## AMBIGUITY HANDLING

**If detection is ambiguous:**
- Combined "Course Description & Objectives" section → verify catalog text actually present before confirming
- Unclear if section is boilerplate → search KB thoroughly; if still unclear (grad courses), flag for user question
- Weak WPC policy link signals → flag as "Verify" rather than making assumption

**If KB guidance is unclear or contradictory:**
- State the limitation explicitly
- Provide closest available guidance
- Note what specific information is missing from KB
